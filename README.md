# Stacks Multisig

This repository contains a project for implementing a multisignature wallet on the Stacks blockchain. A multisig wallet requires multiple parties to approve transactions, enhancing security and decentralization.

## Features

- **Multisignature Transactions**: Require multiple signatures to authorize transactions.
- **Customizable Thresholds**: Define the number of signatures required for approval.
- **Secure and Transparent**: Built on the Stacks blockchain for security and transparency.
- **Clarity Smart Contracts**: Written in Clarity, a secure and predictable smart contract language.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher)
- [Stacks CLI](https://github.com/stacksjs/cli)
- Clarity Developer Tools

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/stacks-multisig.git
    cd stacks-multisig
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Set up environment variables:
    Create a `.env` file and configure necessary variables.

## Usage

### Deploying the Contract

1. Compile the Clarity contract:
    ```bash
    clarinet check contracts/multisig.clar
    ```

### Interacting with the Contract

- **Propose a Transaction**: Use the provided scripts or Stacks CLI to propose a new transaction.
- **Approve a Transaction**: Sign and approve transactions using the wallet interface.
- **Execute a Transaction**: Once the threshold is met, execute the transaction.

## Project Structure

- `contracts/`: Contains Clarity smart contracts.
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts for interacting with the contract.
- `tests/`: Unit tests for the contract.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Testing

Run the test suite to ensure the contract behaves as expected:
```bash
npm test
```
